<h2><ul>Artificial Intelligence is an approach to make a computer, a robot, or a product to think how smart human think. AI is a study of how human brain think, learn, decide and work, when it tries to solve problems. And finally this study outputs intelligent software systems. The aim of AI is to improve computer functions which are related to human knowledge, for example, reasoning, learning, and problem-solving.</ul>
The intelligence is intangible. It is composed of
<ul>1.Reasoning </ul>                      <ul> 2. Learning </ul>                                 <ul>3. Problem Solving</ul>
<ul>4.Perception</ul>                              <ul>5. Linguistic Intelligence</ul>
                  <ul> The objectives of AI research are reasoning, knowledge representation, planning, learning, natural language processing, realization, and ability to move and manipulate objects. There are long-term goals in the general intelligence sector .approaches include statistical methods, computational intelligence, and traditional coding AI. During the AI research related to search and mathematical optimization, artificial neural networks </ul></h2>
